1. A deck is a collection of the individual cards.
2. 6 cards are in the deck.
3. 
   String[] suit = {"Spades", "Clubs", "Hearts", "Diamonds"};
   String[] rank = {"2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10"};
   int[] pointValue = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11};
4. Yes, because the loops match up the ranks and pointvalues and so therefore the order matters.
